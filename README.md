# Development Overview

## Overall Architecture 

This is a native Android app made with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
The app uses a modified version of the [nostrpostrlib](https://github.com/Giszmo/NostrPostr/tree/master/nostrpostrlib) to talk to Nostr relays.
The overall architecture consists in the UI, which uses the usual State/ViewModel/Composition, the service layer that connects with Nostr relays,
and the model/repository layer, which keeps all Nostr objects in memory, in a full OO graph.

The repository layer stores Nostr Events as Notes and Users separately. Those classes use LiveData objects to
allow the UI and other parts of the app to subscribe to each individual Note/User and receive updates when they happen.
They are also responsible for updating viewModels when needed. Filters react to changes in the screen. As the user
sees different Events, the Datasource classes are used to receive more information about those particular Events.

Most of the UI is reactive to changes in the repository classes. The service layer assembles Nostr filters for each need of the app,
receives the data from the Relay, and sends it to the repository. Connection with relays is never closed during the use of the app.
The UI receives a notification that objects were updated. Instances of User and Notes are mutable directly.
There will never be two Notes with the same ID or two User instances with the same pubkey.

Lastly, the user's account information (priv key/pub key) is stored in the Android KeyStore for security.

## Setup

Make sure to have the following pre-requisites installed:
1. Java 11
2. Android Studio
3. Android 8.0+ Phone or Emulation setup

Fork and clone this repository and import into Android Studio
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vitorpamplona/amethyst.git
```

Use one of the Android Studio builds to install and run the app in your device or a simulator.

## Building
Build the app:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Testing
```bash
./gradlew test
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest
```

## Linting
```bash
./gradlew ktlintCheck
./gradlew ktlintFormat
```

## Installing on device
```bash
./gradlew installDebug
```

## How to Deploy

1. Generate a new signing key
```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore <my-release-key.keystore> -alias <alias_name> -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
openssl base64 < <my-release-key.keystore> | tr -d '\n' | tee some_signing_key.jks.base64.txt
```
2. Create 4 Secret Key variables on your GitHub repository and fill in with the signing key information
    - `KEY_ALIAS` <- `<alias_name>`
    - `KEY_PASSWORD` <- `<your password>`
    - `KEY_STORE_PASSWORD` <- `<your key store password>`
    - `SIGNING_KEY` <- the data from `<my-release-key.keystore>`
3. Change the `versionCode` and `versionName` on `app/build.gradle`
4. Commit and push.
5. Tag the commit with `v{x.x.x}`
6. Let the [Create Release GitHub Action](https://github.com/vitorpamplona/amethyst/actions/workflows/create-release.yml) build a new `aab` file.
7. Add your CHANGE LOG to the description of the new release
8. Download the `aab` file and upload it to the` PlayStore.

# Privacy on Relays & nostr
Your internet protocol (IP) address is exposed to the relays you connect to. If you want to improve your privacy, consider utilizing a service that masks your IP address (e.g. a VPN) from trackers online. 

The relay also learns which public keys you are requesting, meaning your public key will be tied to your IP address.

Relays have all your data in raw text. They know your IP, your name, your location (guessed from IP), your pub key, all your contacts, and other relays, and can read every action you do (post, like, boost, quote, report, etc) with the exception of Private Zaps and Private DMs.

# DM Privacy #
While the content of direct messages (DMs) is only visible to you, and your DM nostr counterparty, everyone can see that and when you and your counterparty are DM-ing each other.

# Visibility & Permanence of Your Content on nostr
## Information Visibility ##
Content that you share can be shared to other relays. 
Information that you share is publicly visible to anyone reading from relays that have your information. Your information may also be visible to nostr users who do not share relays with you.

## Information Permanence ##
Information shared on nostr should be assumed permanent for privacy purposes. There is no way to guarantee deleting or editing any content once posted.
